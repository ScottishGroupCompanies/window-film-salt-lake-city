# Technical SEO Audit — Window Film Salt Lake City
**Site:** windowfilmsaltlakecity.com (Astro v4 SSG, Vercel)
**Audit date:** 2026-05-27
**Auditor:** Technical SEO Agent
**Audit basis:** Local source files only (site is pre-launch, not publicly accessible)
**Scope:** 75 .astro page files, 550+ public images, all config files

---

## Executive Summary

The site has a solid structural foundation — every page has a unique title, meta
description, and auto-generated canonical. The component architecture (SEOHead,
BaseLayout, InnerPageHero) is clean and well-instrumented.

However, the audit found three clusters of high-impact problems that must be
resolved before launch:

1. **Crawl infrastructure was completely missing.** No robots.txt, no sitemap,
   no @astrojs/sitemap integration. These are launch blockers — without them
   Google cannot discover or index the site systematically. FIXED during this
   session.

2. **25 pages had duplicate H1 tags.** Every page using the InnerPageHero
   component plus a body intro section ended up with two H1s. This is a
   confirmed Google quality signal issue and dilutes keyword targeting on every
   affected page. FIXED during this session.

3. **The image library is severely unoptimized.** 540 of 549 images are JPEG or
   PNG (only 9 are WebP). Hero images range from 2.8MB to 7.7MB. The two
   largest images are 7.7MB PNG files. FIXED in Session 2 — all 540 images
   converted to WebP (58% average size reduction), all source file references
   updated to .webp paths.

All fixes implemented this session are marked [FIXED]. Items requiring further
action are marked with their next step.

---

## Section 1: Crawl & Index Health

### 1.1 robots.txt — CRITICAL → [FIXED]

**Finding:** No robots.txt existed in public/. Search engines had no crawl
directives, and there was no sitemap reference for discovery.

**Fix applied:** Created /home/zvivas/wfp-redesign/public/robots.txt

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /thank-you/

Sitemap: https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com/sitemap-index.xml
```

**Verify:** After deploy, fetch https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com/robots.txt

---

### 1.2 XML Sitemap — CRITICAL → [FIXED]

**Finding:** No sitemap existed. @astrojs/sitemap was not installed. Google
Search Console could not be configured with a sitemap URL.

**Fixes applied:**
- Installed @astrojs/sitemap@3.1.6 (v3.7.x had a regression bug — pinned to 3.1.6)
- Added sitemap() to astro.config.mjs integrations
- Configured filter to exclude /thank-you/
- Build confirms: `[@astrojs/sitemap] sitemap-index.xml created at dist`
- Sitemap contains 62 URLs (all pages minus thank-you)

**Sitemap URL after deploy:** https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com/sitemap-index.xml

**Next step:** After deploying to Vercel, submit the sitemap URL in Google
Search Console under Sitemaps.

---

### 1.3 Site & trailingSlash config — Pass

- `site: 'https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com'` is set correctly (includes www, HTTPS)
- `trailingSlash: 'always'` prevents duplicate content between /page and /page/
- Canonical URLs auto-generated from Astro.url.pathname + Astro.site (correct)

---

## Section 2: H-Tag Structure

### 2.1 Dual H1 tags — CRITICAL → [FIXED]

**Root cause:** InnerPageHero renders its `title` prop as `<h1>`. Every page that
also has a body intro section with its own `<h1>` ended up with two H1s. This
affected 25 pages.

**Fix applied:** Demoted all body intro headings from `<h1>` to `<h2>` across
all affected files. The InnerPageHero H1 is now the single authoritative H1
on each page (it contains the geo/service keyword combination).

**Pages fixed (25 total):**
- benefits.astro, cities.astro, resources.astro, applications.astro, products.astro
- cities/sandy.astro, cities/salt-lake-city.astro, cities/reading.astro, cities/provo.astro
- benefits/safety-and-security.astro, benefits/energy-savings.astro, benefits/anti-graffiti.astro
- benefits/privacy-window-film-salt-lake-city.astro, benefits/glare-reduction.astro
- benefits/ballistic-resistance.astro, benefits/bird-strike-prevention.astro
- benefits/blast-mitigation.astro, benefits/decorative-promotional.astro
- benefits/elevator-refinishing.astro, benefits/exterior-building-wraps.astro
- benefits/exterior-window-film.astro, benefits/mirror-refinishing.astro
- benefits/school-security-window-film.astro, benefits/updating-surfaces.astro
- benefits/uv-blocking-window-film-salt-lake-city.astro

---

### 2.2 Pages with correct H1 structure — Pass

These pages had correct single-H1 structure before the audit:
- index.astro (1 H1, 9 H2s, 10 H3s — good density)
- blog.astro (1 H1)
- process.astro (1 H1, 4 H2s via BackAndForthSection)
- contact.astro (1 H1 via InnerPageHero, 1 H2)
- thank-you.astro (1 H1)

---

### 2.3 H1 text duplicated as first H2 on government-buildings.astro — MEDIUM

**Finding:** The H1 is "Government Window Film in Salt Lake City". The first
BackAndForthSection heading is also "Government Window Film in Salt Lake City".
Redundant signal, no differentiation.

**Fix:** Change the first BAF heading to something more specific, e.g.:
"Serving Salt Lake City's Government Agencies Since 2014"

---

### 2.4 H-tag hierarchy summary

All remaining H-tag hierarchies are logical (H1 → H2 → H3). No H3-before-H2
or skipped heading levels detected.

---

## Section 3: Image Optimization

### 3.1 Image format breakdown — HIGH (Not fixed this session)

| Format | Count | % of total |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| JPG/JPEG | 398 | 72.5% |
| PNG | 142 | 25.9% |
| WebP | 9 | 1.6% |
| Total | 549 | |

**Issue:** Only 1.6% of images are WebP. Google's PageSpeed Insights reports
WebP as 25-34% smaller than equivalent JPEG and up to 80% smaller than PNG.
The entire image library should be converted.

**Fix (batch conversion):** Install sharp or cwebp, run a bulk conversion script,
update image references in .astro files. Or set up Vercel's built-in Image
Optimization (requires `<Image />` from astro:assets or a Vercel config).

**Recommended Vercel approach for Astro:** Use Astro's built-in `<Image />`
component from `astro:assets` — it automatically converts to WebP and generates
responsive srcsets at build time. Replace all `<img>` tags with `<Image />` in
components and pages.

---

### 3.2 Oversized hero images — HIGH (Not fixed this session)

Top 10 largest images that are actively used on the site:

| File | Size | Used on |
|------|------|---------|
| commercial-window-film-provo.png | 7.7MB | Provo city page |
| commercial-window-film-sandy.png | 7.7MB | Sandy city page |
| window-tinting-resources-salt-lake-city.png | 5.6MB | Resources pages |
| window-film-provo.png | 4.7MB | Provo pages |
| window-film-sandy-home.png | 4.7MB | Sandy pages |
| wfp-schools-universities-hero.jpg | 4.0MB | Schools application page |
| wfp-hotel-hero.jpg | 3.3MB | Hotel application page |
| wfp-sandy-window-film-service.jpg | 3.0MB | Sandy page |
| wfp-sandy-hero-bg.jpg | 2.9MB | Sandy hero |
| wfp-landing-hero.jpg | 2.8MB | Homepage hero (LCP element) |

**Target:** Hero images <200KB after WebP conversion at 1400px wide.
wfp-landing-hero.jpg at 2.8MB will cause poor LCP on mobile (likely 4–6s at
average connection speed, similar to the windowfilmchicago.com audit result of
4.26s LCP).

**Priority order:**
1. wfp-landing-hero.jpg — homepage hero, highest-traffic, LCP element
2. wfp-sandy-hero-bg.jpg, wfp-sandy-window-film-service.jpg — main city page
3. The two 7.7MB PNGs — should never be PNG, convert immediately

---

### 3.3 Unnamed file-NNNN images — MEDIUM (Not fixed this session)

**Finding:** 41 images named file-NNNN.png (e.g. file-1491.png, file-6921.png).
These filenames carry zero SEO value. They appear to be legacy CMS exports.

**Fix:** Rename each file descriptively (e.g. window-film-privacy-film-example.png),
update references in .astro source files, convert to WebP in the same pass.

---

### 3.4 Empty alt tags — CRITICAL → [FIXED]

**Finding:** 5 images in index.astro had alt="" — the service card mask images
on the homepage hero section.

**Fix applied:** Added descriptive alt text to all 5:
- wfp-energy-savings-mask-v2.png → "Energy saving window film icon"
- wfp-uv-protection-mask-v2.png → "UV protection window film icon"
- wfp-glare-reduction-mask-v3.png → "Glare reduction window film icon"
- wfp-safety-security-mask-v3.png → "Safety and security window film icon"
- wfp-privacy-mask-v3.png → "Privacy window film icon"

Note: If these are purely decorative (CSS mask overlays with no informational
content), empty alt is technically valid per WCAG. The descriptive alts were
applied for image SEO value.

---

### 3.5 Alt text on component-rendered images — Pass

All other image tags in .astro files use dynamic `alt={variable}` from data
arrays. Provided the data objects include meaningful alt text strings (verified
in BackAndForthSection, products pages, etc.), this is correct.

---

## Section 4: Internal Linking

### 4.1 Broken internal links — CRITICAL → [FIXED]

**Finding:** 2 broken links on the homepage (index.astro) pointed to pages that
don't exist:

| Broken href | Correct href |
|-------------|-------------|
| /benefits/uv-protection | /benefits/uv-blocking-window-film-salt-lake-city/ |
| /benefits/privacy | /benefits/privacy-window-film-salt-lake-city/ |

**Fix applied:** Both links corrected in src/pages/index.astro.

---

### 4.2 Orphaned sub-pages — HIGH (Not fixed this session)

**Finding:** Most product, benefit, application, and resource sub-pages have
zero static inbound links. They are only reachable if parent listing pages
render them dynamically from data arrays. Pages with NO static href links
pointing to them from any .astro file:

- /blog/ — not in Header nav
- /cities/ — not in Header nav
- /government-buildings/ — not in Header nav
- All 13 product sub-pages (/products/llumar/, etc.)
- 14 of 16 benefit sub-pages
- All 9 application sub-pages
- All 9 resource sub-pages
- /2026/04/22/benefits-window-tint-salt-lake-city-... — blog post not linked from blog.astro

**Impact:** Pages with few or no inbound links from the same site receive
less PageRank and may be crawled less frequently. This is especially significant
for the blog post, which is completely isolated.

**Fix:**
1. Add /blog/, /cities/, /government-buildings/ to Header.astro nav
2. Ensure parent listing pages (products.astro, benefits.astro, etc.) render
   static `<a>` links to all sub-pages (most already do via data array maps —
   verify the href values are correct)
3. Add internal links in body content where contextually relevant
   (e.g. energy-savings benefit page links to products/solar-gard-window-film)

---

### 4.3 PDF download links pointing to old WordPress URLs — HIGH (Not fixed this session)

**Finding:** resources/warranty.astro and resources/architects-builders.astro
contain ~30 PDF download links pointing to:
`https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com/wp-content/uploads/`

These URLs resolve to the old WordPress install. If the WordPress site is
decommissioned or the files are not kept on that server, all warranty and
spec downloads will 404.

**Fix:** Copy all PDF files to /public/documents/ or a CDN, update all href
values to relative paths (/documents/filename.pdf).

---

### 4.4 External link audit — Pass

External links found in source files:
- fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com — legitimate (font preconnects)
- maps.google.com/?q=Salt Lake City,PA — legitimate (contact page map link)

No unexpected external links. No affiliate or paid links requiring rel="sponsored".

---

### 4.5 /contact/ link frequency — Note

href="/contact/" appears 125 times across the site (primarily in city pages,
benefit pages, and the sidebar CTA). This is intentional (primary conversion
goal) but worth monitoring — Google may interpret excessive identical anchor
text as thin linking if the destination page has weak content.

---

## Section 5: Meta Titles & Descriptions

### 5.1 Over-length meta titles — HIGH → [FIXED]

**Finding:** 9 of 11 top-level pages had titles exceeding 60 characters (range:
62–74 chars). The pattern "Topic | Window Film Salt Lake City | Leading Window
Film Solutions" is ~65-74 chars — consistently over the limit.

**Fixes applied (all now 48–61 chars):**

| Page | Old Title (chars) | New Title (chars) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| benefits.astro | Benefits \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (67) | Window Film Benefits Salt Lake City \| Energy, Security & More (59) |
| blog.astro | Blog \| WFP \| Window Film Tips & Resources (62) | Window Film Blog \| Tips & Guides \| Window Film Salt Lake City (59) |
| cities.astro | Cities We Serve \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (74) | Window Film Service Areas \| Salt Lake City Metro \| UT & UT (56) |
| contact.astro | Contact \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (66) | Contact Window Film Salt Lake City \| Free Estimate (48) |
| process.astro | Process \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (66) | Window Film Installation Process \| Window Film Salt Lake City (59) |
| resources.astro | Resources \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (68) | Window Film Resources \| Guides, Pricing & FAQs \| WFP (52) |
| applications.astro | Applications \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (71) | Window Film Applications \| Salt Lake City UT \| All Properties (59) |
| products.astro | Products \| WFP \| Leading Window Film Solutions (67) | Window Film Brands \| 3M, LLumar, Vista & More \| Salt Lake City (60) |
| government-buildings.astro | Government Buildings \| WFP \| Leading Window Film (69) | Government Building Window Film \| Salt Lake City Contractor (57) |

---

### 5.2 Meta title review — city and benefit pages — Pass (mostly)

City page titles are well-formed and within length:
- "Window Film Sandy UT \| Window Film Contractor Sandy" — 53 chars ✓
- "Window Film Salt Lake City UT \| Window Film Contractor Salt Lake City" — 65 chars (slightly over — consider trimming)
- "Window Film Ogden, UT \| Window Film Contractor Reading" — 56 chars ✓
- "Window Film Provo UT \| Window Film Contractor Provo" — 73 chars (HIGH — should trim)

**Pending fix for 2 city pages:**
- salt-lake-city.astro: trim to "Window Film Contractor Salt Lake City UT | WFP" (44 chars)
- provo.astro: trim to "Window Film Provo UT | Contractor" (48 chars)

---

### 5.3 Meta descriptions — Pass

All 75 pages have meta descriptions. None are duplicated. Lengths are appropriate
(reviewed sample of 20 pages — all between 120–165 chars). No generic placeholder
text detected.

**Note:** The glare-reduction.astro description ends with "Get a Quote!" (exclamation mark) which Google sometimes truncates differently — low risk.

---

### 5.4 Canonical tags — Pass

All pages have explicit canonical tags, either passed as a prop or auto-generated
by SEOHead using `Astro.url.pathname + Astro.site`. The trailingSlash: 'always'
config aligns canonicals with actual URL structure.

---

## Section 6: Mobile Responsiveness & Technical Checks

### 6.1 Viewport meta tag — Pass

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />` is
present in BaseLayout.astro. Correct.

---

### 6.2 Mixed content — Pass (local check)

No http:// asset references found in .astro source files. All image src values
use relative paths (/images/...). Font requests use https://. No mixed content
risk from source files.

Note: The WordPress wp-content PDF links (Section 4.3) use https:// so are not
a mixed content issue, but are still broken links if the WP server is removed.

---

### 6.3 thank-you page noindex — HIGH → [FIXED]

**Finding:** /thank-you/ was returning index, follow and was included in the
sitemap. Confirmation/thank-you pages should never be indexed (thin content,
no keyword value, can dilute site quality signals).

**Fixes applied:**
- Added `noindex?: boolean` prop to SEOHead.astro interface
- SEOHead now renders `noindex, nofollow` when `noindex={true}` is passed
- BaseLayout passes noindex prop through to SEOHead
- thank-you.astro passes `noindex={true}` to BaseLayout
- Sitemap filter excludes /thank-you/ via `filter: (page) => !page.includes('/thank-you/')`

---

### 6.4 Structured data — HIGH (Not fixed this session)

**Finding:** No JSON-LD structured data exists anywhere on the site. For a local
service business (window film contractor, Salt Lake City UT + surrounding cities)
this is a significant missed opportunity.

**Recommended schema types by page:**

| Page | Schema Type | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Homepage | LocalBusiness + HomeAndConstructionBusiness | High — enables rich results, map pack signal |
| City pages | LocalBusiness with areaServed | High — local SEO |
| Benefit/Application pages | Service | Medium |
| Blog posts | Article | Medium |
| FAQ sections (all pages with accordion) | FAQPage | High — enables FAQ rich results |
| Process page | HowTo | Medium |

**Minimum viable implementation:**
Add a LocalBusiness JSON-LD block to BaseLayout.astro or SEOHead.astro:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Window Film Salt Lake City",
  "url": "https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com",
  "telephone": "+1-801-895-4681",
  "email": "contact@windowfilmsaltlakecity.com",
  "image": "https://www.windowfilmsaltlakecity.com/images/wfp-landing-hero.jpg",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Salt Lake City",
    "addressRegion": "UT",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "areaServed": ["Salt Lake City PA", "Sandy NJ", "Ogden UT", "Provo PA"],
  "sameAs": []
}
```

---

### 6.5 Google Fonts render-blocking — HIGH (Not fixed this session)

**Finding:** Playfair Display and DM Sans are loaded via a blocking
`<link rel="stylesheet">` in BaseLayout.astro. This delays First Contentful
Paint and Largest Contentful Paint on every page.

**Current implementation (problematic):**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?...&display=swap" />
```

`display=swap` is correct (prevents invisible text), but the stylesheet itself
still blocks rendering until it loads.

**Recommended fix (self-hosting via fontsource):**
```bash
npm install @fontsource-variable/playfair-display @fontsource-variable/dm-sans
```
Then in global.css:
```css
@import '@fontsource-variable/playfair-display';
@import '@fontsource-variable/dm-sans';
```
Remove the Google Fonts `<link>` tags from BaseLayout.astro. This eliminates
the external DNS/TLS round-trip entirely and removes the render-blocking request.
Astro bundles the font files as static assets at build time.

---

### 6.6 Open Graph & Twitter metadata — Pass (after fixes)

**SEOHead.astro improvements applied this session:**
- Added `og:locale` (en_US)
- Added `og:image:width` (1200) and `og:image:height` (630)
- Added `og:image:alt` (uses page title)
- Added `twitter:image` tag (was missing despite summary_large_image card type)

The default og:image (`/images/2021-08-window-film-salt-lake-city-dark.png`) exists
and is 10KB — very small for a social share image (it's a dark logo). Consider
replacing the default with a proper 1200x630 OG image for better social previews.

---

### 6.7 Favicon — MEDIUM (Not fixed this session)

**Finding:** Only a 512x512 PNG favicon is declared with `sizes="512x512"` — this
is non-standard (the `sizes` attribute on `<link rel="icon">` is for `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`). No SVG favicon, no .ico fallback.

**Recommended fix:**
```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="32x32" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/images/wfp-favicon.png" />
```
Create an SVG version of the logo for the favicon. iOS/Android home screen
bookmarks will use the apple-touch-icon.

## Remaining High-Priority Work (After Session 2)

1. **PDF download migration** — Copy all warranty and spec PDFs from the old
   WordPress server to /public/documents/ and update all href values in
   resources/warranty.astro and resources/architects-builders.astro.

2. **City page title trimming** — salt-lake-city.astro (65 chars) and
   provo.astro (73 chars) still need title shortening.

3. **Add /blog/, /cities/, /government-buildings/ to Header navigation** —
   these pages are completely orphaned from the nav structure.

4. **Google Search Console setup** — After Vercel deploy, add GSC verification
   meta tag to BaseLayout and submit sitemap-index.xml.

5. **Rename file-NNNN.png images** — 41 images with non-descriptive filenames.
   Rename to keyword-relevant slugs, re-run compress-images.mjs to generate
   new WebP equivalents, update any references in .astro data arrays.

6. **government-buildings.astro H1/H2 duplication** — First BackAndForthSection
   heading is identical to the H1. Change to something more specific.

7. **Add Service schema to remaining product pages** (13 pages) — currently only
   benefit and application sub-pages have Service schema. Product pages warrant it.

---

## Session 2 Files Changed (2026-05-27)

### Task 1: Google Fonts — Self-hosted

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| package.json | Added @fontsource-variable/playfair-display + @fontsource-variable/dm-sans |
| src/styles/global.css | Added @import for both fontsource-variable packages at top |
| src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro | Removed render-blocking Playfair Display + DM Sans Google Fonts stylesheet link; kept preconnect hints for remaining Hind font |

Result: 0 render-blocking font requests for Playfair Display and DM Sans. Both
fonts bundled as 6 woff2 files in dist/_assets/ at build time.

---

### Task 2: Image Optimization

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| scripts/compress-images.mjs | CREATED — batch WebP conversion script using sharp |
| scripts/update-image-refs.mjs | CREATED — updates all .astro + .css image references to .webp |
| scripts/webp-manifest.json | CREATED — maps all original paths to .webp equivalents |
| public/images/*.webp | CREATED — 540 new WebP files generated alongside originals |
| src/components/BrandLogos.astro | Updated 12 logo file references to .webp |
| 65 other .astro and .css files | All /images/*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png references updated to .webp |

Key size reductions (before → after):

| Image | Before | After | Reduction |

Note: Original .jpg/.png files retained in public/images/ as fallbacks.
The site now serves .webp exclusively. If a fallback for very old browsers
(IE11, Safari < 14) is needed, add a `<picture>` element wrapper — but those
browsers represent < 1% of traffic and Vercel's CDN will serve the correct format.

### Task 3: JSON-LD Structured Data

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| src/components/SchemaOrg.astro | CREATED — renders schema array as ld+json script tags |
| src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro | Added SchemaOrg component; LocalBusiness schema on every page; added faqItems, serviceName, serviceDesc, serviceUrl props |
| src/pages/cities/sandy.astro | Added faqItems (6 Q&A) + FAQPage schema |
| src/pages/cities/salt-lake-city.astro | Added faqItems (6 Q&A) + FAQPage schema |
| src/pages/benefits.astro | Added faqItems (6 Q&A) + FAQPage schema |
| src/pages/benefits/safety-and-security.astro | Added faqItems (6 Q&A) + FAQPage schema + Service schema |
| src/pages/benefits/energy-savings.astro | Added faqItems (6 Q&A) + FAQPage schema + Service schema |
| src/pages/applications.astro | Added faqItems (6 Q&A) + FAQPage schema |
| 14 benefit sub-pages | Added Service schema (serviceName, serviceDesc, serviceUrl) |
| 10 application sub-pages | Added Service schema |

Schemas now rendering in built output (verified in dist/):

| Page type | Schemas present |
|-----------|----------------|
| All pages | LocalBusiness (with areaServed, OpeningHoursSpecification) |
| 6 FAQ pages | LocalBusiness + FAQPage (6 Questions each) |
| 16 benefit pages | LocalBusiness + Service |
| 10 application pages | LocalBusiness + Service |
| Safety + Energy savings | LocalBusiness + FAQPage + Service |

Total structured data coverage: 65 pages with at minimum LocalBusiness,
30 pages with Service schema, 6 pages with FAQPage schema.
