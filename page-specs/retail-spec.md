- Label: `Trusted by Salt Lake City retailers`

### 3. WHAT IS (of-whatis CSS)
- **Eyebrow:** `What Is Retail Window Film?`
- **H2:** `The Invisible Layer Between Your Merchandise and the Elements`
- **Body (2 paragraphs):**
  - P1: Retail window film is a thin, optically clear or lightly tinted polyester layer applied directly to the interior of your storefront glass. It works silently — blocking UV radiation, absorbing solar heat, and (for security grades) reinforcing glass against impact — without changing the look of your display windows or requiring any structural modification.
  - P2: Salt Lake City retailers face a unique challenge: the city's east-facing and south-facing storefronts absorb intense morning and afternoon sun, while historic building facades can't always accommodate exterior shading. Window film is the solution that fits inside the existing architecture and gets to work from day one.
- **3 inline stats:**
  - "Blocks up to 99% of UV-A and UV-B radiation"
  - "Reduces solar heat gain by up to 79%"
  - "Available clear, tinted, frosted, or mirrored"
- **Image:** `re-whatis.jpg` (1376×768)
- **Image alt:** `Retail window film being applied to a Salt Lake City storefront glass`

### 4. THE PROBLEM / WHY (of-why CSS)
- **Eyebrow:** `The Problem`
- **H2:** `Salt Lake City Storefronts Are Working Against Your Business`
- **Intro paragraph:** Salt Lake City's mixed climate — brutal summer sun, glare off the Jordan River and Great Salt Lake, and icy winters — puts enormous stress on glass-heavy retail spaces. Your windows are your biggest marketing asset and your biggest liability.
- **4 climate/problem cards:**
  1. **Merchandise Fading** — UV radiation from even cloudy-day light causes irreversible color shift in fabrics, leather, artwork, and branded packaging. Damage accumulates daily, invisibly.
  2. **Heat Buildup at Display Windows** — Storefronts facing east or south can create hot zones near displays, making customers uncomfortable and damaging heat-sensitive products like candles, chocolate, and cosmetics.
  3. **Glare on POS Terminals & Screens** — Direct sun creates glare that disrupts checkout and makes digital signage unreadable, slowing service and frustrating customers.
  4. **Smash-and-Grab Vulnerability** — Standard retail glass shatters instantly on impact. For jewelers, boutiques, and electronics retailers, a single break-in can cost tens of thousands in merchandise and repairs.

### 6. BENEFIT ROWS (of-row / of-row--rev CSS, 4 rows alternating)

**Row 1 — UV Protection (image LEFT, text RIGHT)**
- **Eyebrow:** `Benefit 01`
- **H2:** `Stop UV Rays Before They Fade Your Merchandise`
- **P1:** UV radiation is the leading cause of merchandise fading — and it comes right through standard glass. Fabrics lose their color. Leather cracks and discolors. Artworks and branded packaging fade unevenly. With [UV-blocking window film](/benefits/uv-blocking-window-film-salt-lake-city/) applied to your storefront glass, up to 99% of UV-A and UV-B radiation is blocked before it ever reaches your shelving.
- **P2:** For Salt Lake City retailers in historic buildings with large single-pane windows — particularly along Walnut Street, South Street, and 9th and 9th — UV protection pays for itself by extending the saleable life of displayed inventory and reducing the frequency of window-display rotations.
- **Bullets:** 99% UV-A and UV-B rejection · No visible color change to storefront · Protects fabrics, leather, artwork, and packaging
- **Image:** `re-uv.jpg` (1376×768) | alt: `UV protection window film on Salt Lake City retail store display windows`

**Row 2 — Energy Savings (text LEFT, image RIGHT)**
- **Eyebrow:** `Benefit 02`
- **H2:** `Reduce the Solar Heat That's Running Up Your Energy Bills`
- **P1:** Glass-heavy retail storefronts are notoriously expensive to cool. Solar heat pours through unprotected windows, forcing HVAC systems to work harder throughout Salt Lake City's humid summer months. [Energy-saving window film](/benefits/energy-savings/) reduces solar heat gain by up to 79%, taking a significant load off your air conditioning and reducing operating costs during peak summer billing cycles.
- **P2:** According to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/update-or-replace-windows), window film is one of the most cost-effective energy upgrades available for existing commercial buildings. For retailers with large south- or east-facing windows, the reduction in cooling demand is measurable from the first billing cycle after installation.
- **Bullets:** Up to 79% solar heat reduction · Lower HVAC demand during peak summer months · DOE-recognized energy upgrade
- **Image:** `re-energy.jpg` (1376×768) | alt: `Energy-efficient window film on Salt Lake City retail storefront reducing cooling costs`

**Row 3 — Glare Reduction (image LEFT, text RIGHT)**
- **Eyebrow:** `Benefit 03`
- **H2:** `Give Customers and Staff a Glare-Free Shopping Environment`
- **P1:** Glare is a silent revenue killer in retail. When sunlight hits your POS screens, digital signage, or fitting room mirrors at the wrong angle, it creates friction at the most important moments of the customer journey. [Glare reduction film](/benefits/glare-reduction/) reduces visible light transmission to a comfortable level — keeping checkout fast, digital screens readable, and fitting room lighting flattering.
- **P2:** For jewelry stores and boutiques where lighting design is critical to the customer experience, glare reduction film gives you control over your light environment without sacrificing the natural light that makes displays pop. Customers spend more time — and money — when they're comfortable.
- **Bullets:** Reduces visible glare by up to 87% · Improves POS and signage readability · Enhances fitting room and display lighting
- **Image:** `re-glare.jpg` (1376×768) | alt: `Glare-free retail store interior with window film in Salt Lake City`

**Row 4 — Security Film (text LEFT, image RIGHT)**
- **Eyebrow:** `Benefit 04`
- **H2:** `Smash-and-Grab Protection That Works Before Police Arrive`
- **P1:** Standard retail glass shatters in seconds. [Security window film](/benefits/safety-and-security/) bonds to the glass and holds the pane together on impact — significantly slowing forced entry and deterring opportunistic thieves who rely on speed. For Salt Lake City jewelers, boutiques, electronics retailers, and any storefront with high-value visible inventory, this is a critical layer of protection.
- **P2:** Security film doesn't just slow intruders — it also protects occupants from flying glass shards during accidental breakage and severe weather. It's a single installation that addresses multiple risk categories, and it works invisibly 24/7 without alarms, cameras, or monitoring contracts.
- **Bullets:** Holds glass together on impact · Deters smash-and-grab entry attempts · Protects against accidental breakage and severe weather
- **Image:** `re-security.jpg` (1376×768) | alt: `Security window film protecting Salt Lake City retail jewelry store from smash-and-grab`

### 13. FAQ (swt-faq__layout, 10 questions — NO time estimates, NO prices)
```js
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "How does window film prevent merchandise fading?",
    answer: "Window film blocks up to 99% of UV-A and UV-B radiation — the primary cause of fading in fabrics, leather, artwork, and branded packaging. Even indirect UV on overcast Salt Lake City days causes cumulative, irreversible damage over time. Our films intercept UV at the glass before it reaches your shelving or display cases."
  },
  {
    question: "Will window film affect how my storefront looks from the street?",
    answer: "It depends on the film type. Solar control films are available in a wide range of visible light transmissions — from nearly invisible to a light tint. Most of our retail clients choose films that maintain or improve the appearance of their storefront while managing heat and glare. We can show you samples on-site before installation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can window film be customized with our brand or logo?",
    answer: "Yes. Decorative and printed films can incorporate brand colors, patterns, logos, and seasonal designs directly on glass. These are applied as window graphics or frosted overlays and are fully removable when your branding changes. We work with your designer or our in-house team to match your brand standards."
  },
  {
    question: "How effective is security film against smash-and-grab theft?",
    answer: "Security film bonds to the glass and holds the pane together on impact, significantly slowing forced entry. Standard retail glass shatters instantly; security film-reinforced glass requires sustained effort to penetrate. For most opportunistic smash-and-grab attempts, this delay is enough to deter entry. It won't make glass impenetrable, but it meaningfully changes the risk calculus for would-be thieves."
  },
  {
    question: "Will film affect the lighting in my store or how products look?",
    answer: "Solar control and UV films in the 70% VLT range have a minimal effect on interior light levels — most customers and staff can't tell the difference. Lower VLT films reduce more glare and heat but also reduce natural light. We'll help you find the right balance for your display strategy and brand aesthetic."
  },
  {
    question: "Is window film permanent?",
    answer: "No — window film is removable, though the process requires care to avoid glass damage. Most commercial films are designed to last 10–15 years under normal conditions. When it's time to remove or replace film, we handle the process as part of our service offering."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with tenants or do you need permission from the building owner?",
    answer: "Most commercial leases allow tenants to install window film as a non-structural improvement. However, we always recommend reviewing your lease agreement and getting written confirmation from your landlord or property manager before installation. We can provide documentation of the film's specifications to help with that process."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to existing window film if I move or close the store?",
    answer: "Film removal is straightforward. We can remove existing film as part of our service, leaving the glass clean and ready for the next tenant. Removal timing and coordination can be arranged to align with your lease-end schedule."
  },
  {
    question: "Does window film help with heat in winter as well as summer?",
    answer: "Yes — Low-E climate control films provide year-round benefit. In summer they reject solar heat. In winter they reflect interior heat back into the space, reducing heating load. For Salt Lake City retailers in historic buildings with single-pane glass, Low-E film is particularly effective at improving year-round comfort and reducing energy costs."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "Contact us for a free on-site consultation. We'll assess your storefront, discuss your priorities — UV protection, energy savings, security, or branding — and recommend specific films that fit your budget, lease terms, and business goals. There's no obligation and no pressure."
